        <h3>Project A</h3>
        <p>The first project I ever did was worked as a floral designer at school.
            We had to create custom orders for parents who subscribed to my teacher's monthly flower giveaway. We also had to arrange flowers for events such as prom, birthday parties, and weddings.
        </p>
        <h3> Project B</h3>
        <p> The second project I did was work as an assistant for a catechism teacher. I had to help the students when they needed help on something, prepare for events, clean the classroom before and after the students came in, and grade students worksheets.</p>
